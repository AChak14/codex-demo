# codex-demo

This repository contains a simple search engine demo built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Running the demo

No build step is required. You can simply open `index.html` in your browser. For a local server (recommended for some browsers), run:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000` and you will see the search page.
